## MacVim website

This is the repository for MacVim's website (https://macvim.org). It is hosted using GitHub Pages on a custom domain. Note that the generated documentation (https://macvim.org/docs) is hosted on a separate repository (https://github.com/macvim-dev/docs), which works because GitHub Pages automatically set up custom domain redirects for individual projects if the root organization page has a custom domain.

This site is also used by the builtin Sparkle updater as it uses https://macvim.org/appcast/latest.xml for information for the latest update.
