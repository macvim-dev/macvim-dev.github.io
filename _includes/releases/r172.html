<p>Updated to Vim 8.2.3455.</p>

<p>Apologies for the late update, as I have not had much time to work on MacVim. This update is primarily to catch up to latest Vim. Future MacVim releases in near future will go back to more bug fixes / features, and addressing potential issues caused by macOS 12.</p>
