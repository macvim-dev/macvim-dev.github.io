<p>Updated to Vim 9.0.0065.</p>

<p>MacVim is now updated to Vim 9!</p>

<p>I just want to apologize for the infrequent update cadence for MacVim over the last year and a half. I have not had much time to work on MacVim, which made catching up harder, leading to a bad feedback loop. I would like to move back to a more regular release cadence to keep MacVim more updated relative to Vim, and to be able to start working on macOS 12/13 integrations as well as fixing outstanding bugs and merging the various pull requests that have been waiting to be merged for a while.  Please don’t hesitate to poke on GitHub if MacVim starts falling behind again.</p>
